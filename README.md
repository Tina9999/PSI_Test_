PSI test (Population Stability Index):
The Population Stability Index (PSI) is a statistical measure used primarily in the context of model validation, particularly for credit scoring models and predictive modeling. 
It measures the stability of a population's distribution over time, comparing the current distribution of a model's predicted scores (or any feature) against a baseline distribution 
(typically from a previous period or sample). 
The PSI is particularly useful for detecting shifts in the data or model drift, which might indicate that the model is no longer performing as expected or that the underlying data distribution has changed.
